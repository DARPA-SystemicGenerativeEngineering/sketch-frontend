%description
SKETCH is a software synthesis tool that allows for rapid development of highly tuned bug-free algorithm implementations. To do this, the programmer develops a sketch, or partial implementation, and a separate specification of the desired functionality. The synthesizer then completes the sketch to behave like the specification. The correctness of the synthesized implementation is guaranteed by the compiler.

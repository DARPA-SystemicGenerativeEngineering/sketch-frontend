The ".skh" files in the main folder provide the abstracted models with required properties.

The actual sketches with and without model are inside model_usage and moresketchified_model_usage folders. The sketches for one time 
verification of models (Second formula in the paper) are in the folder ./model_verification

E.g. The square root based primality test sketch can be found in:  

./moresketchified_model_usage/primality_sqrt/model.sk --Uses Model for sqrt function from Sketch header file: ./sqrt_model.skh

./moresketchified_model_usage/primality_sqrt/nomodel_binarysearch.sk --Uses actual implementation of the sqrt function based on binary search

To synthesize these just run 
>sketch <sketch-filename> 
e.g. 
>sketch ./moresketchified_model_usage/primality_sqrt/model.sk

The verification of the square root model is done by running corresponding sketch file: /model_verification/binarysearch_models_sqrt/check.sh

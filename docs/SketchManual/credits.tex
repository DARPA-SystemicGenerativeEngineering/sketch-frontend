The sketch project was started at UC Berkeley in 2005 by Armando Solar-Lezama and Ras Bodik and has been led by Solar-Lezama at MIT since 2009. The current code base includes important contributions by the following individuals (in chronological order): 
Gilad Arnold,
Liviu Tancau,
Chris Jones,
Nicholas Tung,
Lexin Shan,
Jean Yang,
Rishabh Singh,
Zhilei Xu,
Rohit Singh,
Jeevana Priya Inala,
Xiaokang Qui,
Miguel Velez.
The project also relies heavily on code from MiniSat (Niklas Een, Niklas Sorensson), StreamIt (led by Bill Theis and Saman Amarasinghe with code from David Maze, Michal Karczmarek and others), as well as the open source systems ANTLR (Terence Parr), Apache Commons CLI and Rats/xtc (Robert Grimm).

Over the years, the project has benefited from funding by the following projects:
\begin{itemize}
\item NSF-1049406 EAGER:Human-Centered Software Synthesis
\item NSF-1116362  SHF: Small: Human-Centered Software Synthesis
\item NSF-1161775 SHF: Medium: Collaborative Research: Marrying program analysis and numerical Search
\item DOE: ER25998/DE-SC0005372: Software Synthesis for High Productivity Exascale Computing
\item NSF-1139056 Collaborative Research: Expeditions in Computer Augmented Programming
\item DARPA: UHPC Program
\item DOE: ER26116/DE-SC0008923: D-TEC: DSL Technology for Exascale Computing 
\end{itemize}

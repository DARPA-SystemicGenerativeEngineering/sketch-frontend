\section{Regression tests and Benchmark Suite}

The sketch distribution includes a set of regression tests that exercise the different corner cases of the language and is important if you are making modifications to the compiler. The tests can be found in the directory \C{src/test/sk/seq} if you are using the mercurial distribution, or \C{test/sk/seq} if you are using the easy-to-install version. After having installed the synthesizer, you can run \C{make long} or \C{make} if you want the short version of the test. The main difference between the long and the short tests is that the long tests do code generation and test the generated code on random inputs, whereas the short test only checks that the synthesizer doesn't crash.

The distribution also includes a benchmark suite that you can use to evaluate new synthesis algorithms and compare their effect against the standard sketch distribution. This can be run from the \C{release_benchmarks} directory (or \C{src/release_benchmarks}) by running \C{bash perftest.sh OUTDIR}, where \C{OUTDIR} is a directory where logs should be written. Running the full benchmark suite takes about a day because every test is run 15 times to gather meaningful statistics, but you can modify the script to make it run faster. Once the benchmark suite is running, you can view relevant statistics by running 

\C{> cat OUTDIR/* | awk -f ../scripts/stats.awk}.

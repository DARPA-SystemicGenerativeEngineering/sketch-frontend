If you are using windows, start by running 

bash convertScripts.sh
If you checked out the distribution from CVS and you want to create a 
streamlined distribution package, you can run the following commands:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make dist

To actually build the executable, you should do 

./autogen.sh
./configure
make 
make install

Note: If you are using cygwin on Vista, perl 5.10 will crash. Use 5.8 instead.

If you get a sketch distribution, simply run

./configure && make && sudo make install

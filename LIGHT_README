Simple Setup Instructions:
These instructions allow you to run the sketch compiler without installing it.
1. Dependencies
Before building you need to have the following tools installed:
bash autoconf flex bison libtool

2. Building the backend
cd sketch-backend
./configure
make
cd ..

3. Testing the sketch
cd sketch-frontend
./sketch test/sk/seq/miniTest1.sk

This should print out the completed sketch.

4. (Optional) setting environment variables
export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`"
export SKETCH_HOME="`pwd`/runtime"
The first one will let you run sketch from anywhere, and the second one will allow the code generators to find the runtime libraries.

5. (Optional) thorough test
If you want to run the completed test suites, run the following commands:
cd test/sk/seq
make long
This will run the complete sketch test suites.
